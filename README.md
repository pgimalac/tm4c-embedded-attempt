# My (almost) first embedded attempt
This repository contains my code for the [`Embedded Systems - Shape The World`](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/) course from Austin university by Jonathan Valvano and Ramesh Yerraballi.

### ♥ Linux ♥
This course was made for Windows (using Keil uVision), but I use Arch, so obviously I had to tinker - for my greatest pleasure - to follow it on Linux. I don't have access to the correction, the templates nor the evaluator so I can't really check that what I'm doing is perfect, but I hope so.

### Repository
Each lab will be on a separate branch, either coming from the `dev` branch or from another lab.

#### How to run
A makefile is provided to build and flash the code onto the board.

I tried to use CCStudio but without success.

### edX
I followed the course from the [edX website](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-i).

### Lab n°6
The objective of this lab is to write a program such as the led is turned on at first, then there is a 100ms delay and if the switch 1 is pressed then the led is turned off and on, else the led is just turned on.
